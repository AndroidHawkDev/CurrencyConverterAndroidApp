# CurrencyConverterAndroidApp
First Android Studio Application with Github. Will upgrade so I can uplaod this on PlayStore.
I am just a beginner Android Developer. Using Github to improve my Development Skills and get more ideas from other users. 
I tried learning Kotlin language but then I decided I should focus on one language instead of collecting everything and failing.
